# Implementation of a 1-mic CIC Filter

This example tries to implement a 1-mic CIC filter.

The CLK signal used for sampling the microphone is generated by the BeagleBone Black (host) itself (see [PWM-HOWTO.md](PWM-HOWTO.md) for more details on that) and output to the microphone and the PRUs implementing a CIC filter.

PRU1 does the processing.
