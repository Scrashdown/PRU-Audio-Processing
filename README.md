# PRU-Audio-Processing

This is the repository of my bachelor's project.

## Setup

### Get UIO to work and free the GPIO pins for the PRU (*in progress*)

*Note: this was tested on this kernel:* `Linux beaglebone 4.4.91-ti-r133 #1 SMP Tue Oct 10 05:18:08 UTC 2017 armv7l GNU/Linux`

In order to run the filter, we need to be able to use the input and output pins from the PRUs. Some of them can be multiplexed to the PRUs. However, by default, some pins cannot be reassigned to something else. To correct this, we need to load a [cape](https://elinux.org/Capemgr). To do so, open the `/boot/uEnv.txt` file on the board (backup it first!) and do the following modifications :

Add the following line :

    cape_enable=bone_capemgr.enable_partno=cape-universala

And comment the following line :

    enable_uboot_cape_universal=1

You should now be able to multiplex a pin to the PRUs using the `config-pin` command (see these [instructions](Documentation/pins.md) for more details). We still have to enable the UIO driver, which is disabled in favor of remoteproc on this kernel. To do so, still in the `/boot/uEnv.txt` file, comment that line :

    uboot_overlay_pru=/lib/firmware/AM335X-PRU-RPROC-4-4-TI-00A0.dtbo

And uncomment this one :

    uboot_overlay_pru=/lib/firmware/AM335X-PRU-UIO-00A0.dtbo

Then :

    $ cd /opt/source/dtb-4.4-ti
    $ sudo nano src/arm/am335x-boneblack.dts

Comment that line :

    #include "am33xx-pruss-rproc.dtsi"

And uncomment this one :

    #include "am33xx-pruss-uio.dtsi"

Then close nano and run the following commands :

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

This is the final step. Run `sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/pruss-blacklist.conf` and add the following lines :

    blacklist pruss
    blacklist pruss_intc
    blacklist pru-rproc

Now reboot the board, and you should be able to run commands such as `config-pin -q P8.45` without trouble.

### Install PRUSS Driver (`prussdrv`)

In order to install the PRUSS driver on the host side, first clone this [repo](https://github.com/beagleboard/am335x_pru_package) and then follow the "Development tools" section of these [instructions](http://mythopoeic.org/bbb-pru-minimal/).
